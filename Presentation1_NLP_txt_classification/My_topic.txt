I will give a small brief on techniques on text extraction from images           later when we show the code we will go a bit brief.
generally we use 5 techniques

Preprocessing involves techniques like noise reduction, contrast adjustment, and thresholding to enhance image quality for text extraction. But, thresholding is typically used as the primary method for this task.

Where as OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is used to recognize and convert text from images into machine-readable format.

Text localization identifies regions containing text in an image using methods like edge detection and component analysis.

Text segmentation breaks down the text into lines, words, or characters for accurate extraction.

Finally, Deep learning models like CNNs and RNNs improve text recognition, especially in complex or noisy images.

General applications of text classifications are

Spam detection in emails, messages.

Sentiment analysis for customer reviews  social media.

Topic categorization for news articles, blogs, and research papers.
Document classification in legal, scientific, or medical fields.

Language identification in multilingual texts.

Customer support ticket categorization for efficient routing. and many others




Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity
